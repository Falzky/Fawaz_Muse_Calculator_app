# Calculator App ðŸ”¢

This is a basic calculator I built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It was part of my AltSchool Africa frontend assessment and helped me understand how to combine all three technologies in a single project.

## Features
- Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
- Clean UI and simple layout
- Responsive design (in progress)

## Lessons Learned
- DOM manipulation
- Event handling in JavaScript
- Structuring CSS and HTML effectively

## Status
Still improving this project as I grow my JavaScript skills.
